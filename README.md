# Smart-Sewage-Monitoring-System

The Sewage Monitoring System Project is a comprehensive endeavor aimed at revolutionizing wastewater management by leveraging advanced technology for real-time monitoring and analysis. This executive summary provides an overview of the project's objectives, key findings, and recommendations.
Objectives
The primary objective of the Sewage Monitoring System Project is to develop and implement an innovative system for monitoring sewage networks in urban areas. This system aims to enhance environmental sustainability, public health, and operational efficiency by providing timely data on sewage flow rates, quality, and potential hazards.
Outcome
The Sewage Monitoring System demonstrated significant capabilities in detecting and analysing various parameters and anomalies such as blockages or leaks. Real-time data transmission facilitated prompt response to critical events, minimizing environmental risks and optimizing maintenance activities. Moreover, the system's user-friendly interface and customizable alerts streamlined decision-making processes for municipal authorities and environmental agencies.

The Sewage Monitoring and Maintenance Alert system stands as a transformative solution poised to revolutionize sewage management practices worldwide. By seamlessly integrating real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and proactive maintenance capabilities, this innovative system offers a holistic approach to addressing the complex challenges faced by municipalities, wastewater treatment plants, and environmental agencies.
With its ability to continuously monitor sewage networks, detect anomalies, and issue proactive alerts, the Sewage Monitoring and Maintenance Alert system empowers stakeholders to take preemptive measures to prevent overflow incidents, equipment failures, and environmental pollution. This proactive approach not only safeguards public health and the environment but also enhances operational efficiency and resource utilization within sewage management infrastructure.

Components used 

Esp 8266 MCU -1
HW131 breadboard power connector -1
12V ADAPTER-1
Jumper wires
LED-1
330ohm resistors-1
HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor-1
Float sensor-1


The smart device utilizes two primary sensors to collect real-time data: the HCSR04 Ultrasonic sensor and a water level sensor. The ultrasonic sensor continuously emits ultrasonic waves to detect any obstructions within the sewage system. Upon detection of a blockage, notifications are triggered, alerting relevant personnel to the issue. Meanwhile, the water level sensor monitors sewage levels, promptly notifying users if levels exceed predetermined thresholds, indicating an imminent overflow.
The project employs the ESP8266 microcontroller and Wi-Fi module to execute logical and mathematical operations within the system. These components facilitate seamless integration with the Blynk IoT application, enabling real-time data transmission and remote monitoring. Specifically, the ESP8266 communicates sensor readings to the Blynk cloud, allowing users to monitor drainage system status via the Android application. Moreover, push notifications are sent to users' mobile devices in the event of blockages or overflow scenarios, ensuring timely response and mitigation efforts.
